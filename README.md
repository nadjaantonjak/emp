Creating a Homework Assignment that applies knowledge learn in class to create a employee tracker.


Keeping organised throughout my course is what motivated me todo this assignment . Creating a application that can be used by yourself potentially in the future is really rewarding knowing youve created something that is helping you in the long run.

This project was bulit to help keep on track of employees throughout companies . Having a employee tracker can ease the stress knowing what needs to be saved and secured is there and no information is missed.

With using a employee tracker managers can keep organised and on top of their staff it solves the problem of forgetting peoples information. new emplyees are easily put into the system aswell leaving no hasstle.

What i learned and skills ive strengthned

I believe my project stands out due to my clear display,and easy access to everything needed to be viewed, everything is organised in one place and can be acceses quickly or edited if needed.
